# MANUfacturing Edge Lightweight Accelerator - Development Project

This is the “in-storyline-only” development repository. It contains anything and only those things that a developer who works on the manuela application components would be concerned with. It is part of the (MANUela)[https://github.com/sa-mw-dach/manuela.git] project. Check it out for documentation and how to use it in the demonstration.

This repo containts all development artefacts, i.e. source code of the different components, build pipeline, CodeReadyWorkspace Dev files. Kubernetes/OpenShift artifacts are included to a degree that allows build & deployment on Openshift for development purposes. All contents are namespace-agnostic, i.e. can be deployed into different namespaces in parallel.

You have two options to develop.

## Use local laptop with VSCode or similiar.
TODO: Instructions on how to setup local dev.

## Use Code Ready Workspaces
You could use your own Code Ready Workspace where everything necessary is already setup.
That is actually part of the demo, please see the Demo Script for the CloudeIDE
